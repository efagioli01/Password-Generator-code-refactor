## 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Assignemnt

For the third homework assignment in week three of UNH Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp I was to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on certain criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

## The User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Description

This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria when the generate password button is clicked on. When the button is clicked on, the user is asked a series of questions. The user is first prompted to enter a number for how many characters they would like to use in their password. If the user enters a letter or symbol in place of a number, they are alerted to enter a valid number. If the use enters any number less than 8 or more than 128, they recieve an alert message to enter a number between 8 and 128. Next, the user is prompted to click Ok is using numbers, special characters, upper case letters, or lower case letters in their password. If they user click cancel for each criteria, the are alerted they need to choose at least one character type. Once all prompts are answered and verified, the user will be presented with a password matching what they chose in the prompts.
